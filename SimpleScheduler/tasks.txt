1. make simpleshell work in the program - done
2. make a submit bash script calls a submit executable that creates new process
    ^fucked cause we don't have to make a shell script, we have to make a new linux command ergo bash scriting in useless
   to run the executable passed by the user.-now done
   2.1 The scheduler maintains a queue of processes that are ready for execution
       Q: can we maintain processes using SIGSTOP and SIGCONT


Qs:
what is the use of dummy main
any number of jobs? should we have functionality for adding a command line parameter that makes multiple jobs for the same executable?
how should submit communicate with simplescheduler
how do we use timers in C to freeze execution of one process and start another
    there is an idea of SIGVTALRM to pause execution
